My research interests are broadly in the areas of cyber-physical systems, computer architecture, and security. I am particularly focusing on the secure and efficient operation of multi-tenant data centers (also known as "colocation").

I am working towards my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering under the supervision of Dr. Shaolei Ren.
